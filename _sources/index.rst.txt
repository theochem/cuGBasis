ChemToolsCUDA is a free, and open-source C++/CUDA and Python library for computing various quantities efficiently
using NVIDIA GPU's in quantum chemistry. It is highly-optimized and vectorized, making it useful for cases
where efficiency matters. It has substantial speed-ups compared to both commerical and open-source post-processing
quantum chemistry codes.

ChemToolsCUDA can read various wave-function formats (wfn, wfx, molden and fchk) using IOData and supports up-to g-type
(Cartesian or Pure) orbitals. It can compute the following features:

* Molecular orbitals
* Electron density
* Gradient of electron density
* Laplacian of electron density
* Hessian of electron density
* Electrostatic potential
* Compute density-based descriptors:

  * Reduced density gradient
  * Shannon information density
  * Norm of gradient

* Compute various kinetic energy densities:

  * Positive definite kinetic energy density
  * General kinetic energy density
  * Von Weizsacker kinetic Energy Density
  * Thomas-Fermi kinetic energy density.
  * General gradient expansion approximation of kinetic energy density
